# Chapter 10: Program Organisation

## Reading Notes

- Local variables have 2 properties: *automatic storage duration* & *block scope*.
    - To make a local variable to have *static storage duration*, use `static` keyword.
- External variables (global variables) have 2 properties: *static storage duration* & *file scope*. 

## Exercising Notes

- Both project 3, project 4 and project 5 have been done in only [code file](./projects/03-05.c).
